## Mars Rover Challenge


### Run the app

The recommended way is to run the unit tests CMD + U.
There is a quickly thrown together interface with three buttons that execute the sample app


The sample data is used in MarsRoverTests.swift under unit tests (MarsRoverTests)


TODO:

- [ ] Document all code
- [ ] Add UI elements for user to interact with the app
- [ ] Add validation rules. Max coordinate = 50, max instructions length = 100


Good test coverage on my code. ViewControllers and Delegates are hard to test and would fare much better with UI tests
